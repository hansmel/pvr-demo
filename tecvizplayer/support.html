<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Do I need to pre-register?</h4>
No. Join the events using the Ericsson Joy site, or the calendar invitations. You will need to login using an Ericsson, Red Bee or Cradlepoint email address to join the event on the external event platform.

<h4>Who is invited?</h4>
All employees of Ericsson, Red Bee Media and Cradlepoint.
<p></p>
Managers can forward the invite or share the link with their team members who have not received the calendar invites, such as consultants with an Ericsson email address.

<h4>Do I need a password?</h4>
No, you just need to use your Ericsson, Red Bee or Cradlepoint email address to enter the event platform 

<h4>Can I only join the event in my time zone?</h4>
You are welcome to join all three events, which is why you have been sent three calendar invites. However, the event broadcast for your region is probably more convenient to watch.

<h4>Can I share the link with a friend?</h4>
No, the links only work for employees of Ericsson and our wholly owned subsidiaries. But you may – and we encourage you to! – watch the concerts with the members of your household.

<h4>Can I invite my friends and neighbors to watch with me?</h4>
Please follow the guidelines and restrictions that are in place in your country when it comes to social gatherings. And remember that you may not share the links externally and should therefore watch from your own device.

<h4>If I don’t want to stay up all night to view one of the concerts, will it be available on demand later?</h4>
The concerts will be available on-demand 48 hours after the live event.

<h4>Can we watch the concerts together at the office?</h4>
We ask you to please follow the restrictions that are in place to limit gathering at the office. We can watch together, but virtually!

<h4>Can I share the event or content on social media?</h4>
You may not share, record or stream content from the concerts on social media or external channels.
Remember to upload your Joy photos to the Ericsson Joy site and share them on Yammer using #ericssonjoy2021.
